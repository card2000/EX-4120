<p>The JIS codec provides conversion to and from ISO 2022-JP.</p>
<p>The environment variable <tt>UNICODEMAP_JP</tt> can be used to fine-tune the JIS, Shift-JIS, and EUC-JP codecs. The mapping names are as for the Japanese XML working group's <a href="http://www.y-adagio.com/public/standards/tr_xml_jpf/toc.htm">XML Japanese Profile</a>, because it names and explains all the widely used mappings. Here are brief descriptions, written by Serika Kurusugawa:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;unicode-0.9&quot; or &quot;unicode-0201&quot; for Unicode style. This assumes JISX0201 for 0x00-0x7f. (0.9 is a table version of jisx02xx mapping used for Unicode 1.1&#x2e;)</li>
<li>&quot;unicode-ascii&quot; This assumes US-ASCII for 0x00-0x7f; some chars (JISX0208 0x2140 and JISX0212 0x2237) are different from Unicode 1.1 to avoid conflict.</li>
<li>&quot;open-19970715-0201&quot; (&quot;open-0201&quot; for convenience) or &quot;jisx0221-1995&quot; for JISX0221-JISX0201 style. JIS X 0221 is JIS version of Unicode, but a few chars (0x5c, 0x7e, 0x2140, 0x216f, 0x2131) are different from Unicode 1.1&#x2e; This is used when 0x5c is treated as YEN SIGN.</li>
<li>&quot;open-19970715-ascii&quot; (&quot;open-ascii&quot; for convenience) for JISX0221-ASCII style. This is used when 0x5c is treated as REVERSE SOLIDUS.</li>
<li>&quot;open-19970715-ms&quot; (&quot;open-ms&quot; for convenience) or &quot;cp932&quot; for Microsoft Windows style. Windows Code Page 932. Some chars (0x2140, 0x2141, 0x2142, 0x215d, 0x2171, 0x2172) are different from Unicode 1.1&#x2e;</li>
<li>&quot;jdk1.1&#x2e;7&quot; for Sun's JDK style. Same as Unicode 1.1, except that JIS 0x2140 is mapped to UFF3C. Either ASCII or JISX0201 can be used for 0x00-0x7f.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the extensions &quot;nec-vdc&quot;, &quot;ibm-vdc&quot; and &quot;udc&quot; are supported.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to use Unicode style conversion but with NEC's extension, set <tt>UNICODEMAP_JP</tt> to <tt>unicode-0.9, nec-vdc</tt>. (You will probably need to quote that in a shell command.)</p>
