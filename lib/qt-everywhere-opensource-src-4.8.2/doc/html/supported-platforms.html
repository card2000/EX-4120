<p>Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework. Using Qt, you can write GUI applications once and deploy them across desktop, mobile and embedded operating systems without rewriting the source code.</p>

<h2>Supported Platform Details</h2>
<p>The Qt team strives to provide support for the platforms most frequently used by Qt users. We have designed our internal testing procedure to divide platforms into three test categories (Tier 1 and Tier 2) in order to prioritize internal testing and development resources so that the most frequently used platforms are subjected to our most rigorous testing processes.</p>
<p>Qt is supported on a variety of 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and can usually be built on each platform with GCC, a vendor-supplied compiler, or a third party compiler. Although Qt may be built on a range of platform-compiler combinations, only a subset of these are actively supported by Nokia.</p>
<p>Information about the specific platforms Qt runs on, and the compilers used on each platform, can be found on the <a href="platform-notes.html">Platform and Compiler Notes</a> page.</p>
<a name="tier-1-platforms"></a>
<h2>Tier 1 Platforms</h2>
<p>All Tier 1 platforms are subjected to our unit test suite and other internal testing tools on a frequent basis (prior to new version releases, source tree branching, and at other significant period points in the development process). Errors or bugs discovered in these platforms are prioritized for correction by the development team. Significant errors discovered in Tier 1 platforms can impact release dates and Qt Development Frameworks strives to resolve all known high priority errors in Tier 1 platforms prior to new version releases.</p>

<h2>Tier 2 Platforms</h2>
<p>Tier 2 platforms are subject to ad hoc and internal testing. However, Qt users should note that errors may be present in released product versions for Tier 2 platforms and, subject to resource availability, known errors in Tier 2 platforms may or may not be corrected prior to new version releases.</p>
