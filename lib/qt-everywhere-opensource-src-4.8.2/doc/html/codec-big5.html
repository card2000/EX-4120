<p>The Big5 codec provides conversion to and from the Big5 encoding. The code was originally contributed by Ming-Che Chuang &lt;mingche@cobra.ee.ntu.edu.tw&gt; for the Big-5+ encoding, and was included in Qt with the author's permission, and the grateful thanks of the Qt team. (Note: Ming-Che's code is QPL'd, as per an mail to qt-info@nokia.com.)</p>
<p>However, since Big-5+ was never formally approved, and was never used by anyone, the Taiwan Free Software community and the Li18nux Big5 Standard Subgroup agree that the de-facto standard Big5-ETen (zh_TW.Big5 or zh_TW.TW-Big5) be used instead.</p>
<p>The Big5 is currently implemented as a pure subset of the Big5-HKSCS codec, so more fine-tuning is needed to make it identical to the standard Big5 mapping as determined by Li18nux-Big5. See <a href="http://www.autrijus.org/xml/">http://www.autrijus.org/xml/</a> for the draft Big5 (2002) standard.</p>
<p>James Su &lt;suzhe@turbolinux.com.cn&gt; &lt;suzhe@gnuchina.org&gt; generated the Big5-HKSCS-to-Unicode tables with a very space-efficient algorithm. He generously donated his code to glibc in May 2002. Subsequently, James has kindly allowed Anthony Fok &lt;anthony@thizlinux.com&gt; &lt;foka@debian.org&gt; to adapt the code for Qt.</p>
