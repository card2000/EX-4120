<p>The EUC-JP codec provides conversion to and from EUC-JP, the main legacy encoding for Unix machines in Japan.</p>
<p>The environment variable <tt>UNICODEMAP_JP</tt> can be used to fine-tune the JIS, Shift-JIS, and EUC-JP codecs. The <a href="codecs-jis.html">ISO 2022-JP (JIS) Text Codec</a> documentation describes how to use this variable.</p>
